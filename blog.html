              <h5 class="card-title">What are the differences between local storage and session storage?</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the user closes its browser window.

                Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each one will have its own page session.  
                
                Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or manually.

              <h5 class="card-title">How does the Event loop of javascript works?</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the Event loop triggers and checks the task Queue for available callbacks.The concept of asyncronous programming in javascript gives enough insight to clearly understand what is going on under the hood and how javascript is able to run concurrently and asyncronously with just a single thread.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">How many ways can we find the undefined in javascript?</h5>
              <p class="card-text"> The type of keyword returning "undefined" can mean one of two things: the variable is the primitive "undefined", or the variable has not been declared at all. In Javascript programming, we will encounter the primitive data type undefined, which indicates the absence of value. Js variables start with the value of undefined if they are not given a value when they are declared (or inizialized) using var, let, const.

              <h5 class="card-title">What are the differences between global scope and block scope?</h5>
              <p class="card-text">                
                Before ES6, JavaScript only had function and global scope whice means that a variable declared inside a function lived inside the function and a variable declared outside a function could live anywhere.

                With ES6, JavaScript introduced the let keyword and block scope. Block scope means that if a variable is declared using let or const in a code block it lives only in that code block.

               So we can say, the global sope is an old version and block scope is the new version of javascript
